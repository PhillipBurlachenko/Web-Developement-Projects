        <h4>Purchase a Fishing License!</h4>
        <article>
        <p>To get into fishing, you must first purchase a license because it is illegal to fish without one! Almost all public waters are governed by the Fish and Wildlife organization. The purchase of a license helps fund this organization that protects our wildlife. Luckily the licenses are affordable, and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife made it easy to purchase one!</p>
