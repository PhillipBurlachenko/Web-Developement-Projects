        <h1>Targeting a species of fish!</h1>
        <h4>What species to choose?</h4>
        <article>
        <p>Figuring out what species of fish to go after is not always a easy task. There are many factors that come in to play like time of season, weather conditions, water quality, and time of day. The best approach to choose one is to determine if the fish is in season to catch, and what type of action your in the mood for! The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife website gives you a ton of information in regards to bodies of water, and the types of species that reside there.</p>
